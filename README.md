## **Understanding speech signal**
* Analysing speech signals has become far more important after the invent of AI.
* It has many applications from simple implementations like **Alexa, Siri ,Automatic text transcriptions** to complex approaches like **detecting Dementia using a conversation with a patient or emotion detection of a customer who is on a phone call.**
* In order to develop Machine learning models for such applicatuions, it's really important to understand what a speech segment is actually made up of.
* Throgh this project i learnt,
  1. How to visualize a speech signal
  2. What are its frequency domain features
  3. How to extarct spectograms from speech
  4. How time-frerqiency domain features can be extracted and whats their significance
